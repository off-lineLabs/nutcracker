**Effective Date:** October 15th 2025
**Last Updated:** October 15th 2025

## Introduction

NutCracker ("the App") is developed and published by Offline Labs ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use our App.

**Our Privacy-First Commitment:** NutCracker is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers. We do not have servers. We do not track your personal behavior, profile you, or sell your data to third parties.

However, the App does interact with certain third-party services that may collect limited technical data as described below.

----------

## Information We Collect

### We Collect Nothing Directly

**We do not:**

-   Collect personal information (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.)
-   Track your app's data
-    Store your data on external servers
-   Use advertising or analytics trackers
-   Share your information with third parties for marketing purposes

**All your data stays on your device.** Your nutrition logs, exercise data, meal plans, and any other information you enter into the App remain locally stored on your device only.

----------

## Third-Party Services & Data Collection

While we don't collect data ourselves, the App uses third-party services and APIs that may collect limited technical information:

### 1. Google Play Services (Crash Reporting)

**What it does:** Automatically collects crash and diagnostic data to help identify and fix bugs.

**What may be collected:**

### 2. ML Kit Barcode Scanning (Google)

**What it does:** Processes barcode images to scan product barcodes.

**What may be collected:**

**Note:** Open Food Facts is a non-profit, open-source project that does not sell user data.

### 5. Third-Party Libraries

The App uses various open-source Android libraries for functionality. While we carefully select libraries that respect user privacy, we cannot guarantee that future updates to these libraries won't introduce data collection. If we become aware of privacy-invasive behavior in any library, we will undertake efforts to replace it in future app updates.

----------

## How We Use Information

We do not collect any personal information directly. However, we do access and analyze crash reports collected by Google Play Services for the sole purpose of:
- Identifying and fixing bugs
- Improving app stability and performance
- Resolving technical issues

This crash data is anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. We use it only for app maintenance and never for marketing, profiling, or any other purpose.

The third-party services mentioned above (Open Food Facts, GitHub, ML Kit) may use data as described in their respective privacy policies, but we have no access to or control over that data.

----------

## Data Storage & Security

**All your personal data is stored locally on your device only.**

We do not have access to:

-   Your nutrition logs
-   Your exercise records
-   Your meal plans
-   Your personal settings
-   Any data you enter into the App

**Your responsibility:** Since data is stored on your device, you are responsible for:

-   Backing up your data (via device backup features)
-   Securing your device with a password/PIN
-   Understanding that uninstalling the App will delete your local data

----------

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any user information** because we do not collect any user information.

The third-party services mentioned above may share data as described in their privacy policies, but we have no control over or visibility into their practices.

----------

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since we do not collect personal information at all, the App can be used by children, but we recommend parental supervision for minors.

----------

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store your personal data:

-   **Access:** All your data is already accessible to you on your device
-   **Deletion:** Uninstall the App to delete all local data
-   **Portability:** You can back up your device to preserve your data
-   **Correction:** You can edit your data directly in the App

For data collected by third-party services (Google, Open Food Facts, GitHub), please refer to their respective privacy policies and exercise your rights directly with them.

----------

## International Data Transfers

The third-party services we use (Google, Open Food Facts, GitHub) may transfer and process data in countries outside your own. Please review their privacy policies for information about international data transfers and safeguards.

----------

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, particularly if we:

We will notify you of significant changes by:
